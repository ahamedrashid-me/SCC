SuperCode Programming Language

Welcome to SuperCode, a statically-typed programming language built for performance and memory safety. It combines a modern, ergonomic syntax with powerful features like a Rust-inspired ownership model and compile-time constants. The language is designed to help developers write robust, high-performance applications with confidence.
Key Features
üíª Syntax and Structure

SuperCode programs are organized into modules and have a single entry point: the run block. It uses square brackets [] for function calls, providing a distinct and clean syntax.

    Ergonomic Syntax: Square brackets [] for function calls and the -> operator for structs.

    Program Structure: Organized into modules, with a main entry point in the run block.

    Comments: Supports both single-line (//) and multi-line (/? ?/) comments.

üß† Data and Types

SuperCode is statically-typed and offers a rich set of built-in types. This design ensures that type-related errors are caught at compile time.

    Simple Types: Includes num, deci, text, char, bool, and low-level types like byte and ubyte.

    Null Safety: Types are non-nullable by default. Optional data is handled with nullable types, denoted by a question mark (?).

    Immutability: The val keyword creates true compile-time constants, ensuring zero-runtime-overhead immutable values.

    Advanced Types: Supports user-defined composite types with struct and type-safe enums with enum.

‚öôÔ∏è Control Flow and Error Handling

The language provides a set of powerful and readable control flow structures, simplifying complex logic.

    Conditional Logic: The if-or-else structure offers a flexible way to handle branching, with or blocks acting as else if.

    Pattern Matching: The repeat-when-fixed structure provides a type-safe alternative to traditional switch-case statements.

    Looping: It has both a C-style for loop and a convenient for-each loop for iterating over collections.

    Robust Error Handling: The try-catch-finally block allows for safe handling of runtime exceptions, with a dedicated block that always executes for cleanup.

üõ°Ô∏è Memory Safety

A core feature of SuperCode is its Rust-inspired memory model, which prevents common memory-related bugs at compile time.

    Ownership Model: The take, give, and free keywords provide explicit control over memory, ensuring that every piece of data has a single, clear owner.

    Automatic Deallocation: The compiler tracks ownership to automatically manage memory and prevent common issues like dangling pointers and double-frees.

Getting Started
Installation

SuperCode is currently under development. The SuperCode compiler, which translates .su files into native binaries, is available for download on the releases page.

# Example: Download the compiler and add to your PATH
wget https://github.com/your-repo/supercode/releases/download/v0.1/sc_compiler-v0.1.zip
unzip sc_compiler-v0.1.zip
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/sc_compiler


Writing Your First Program

Create a file named hello.su with the following code. For more examples, see the ../examples/ directory.

// Define a function that returns a num
fnc add_numbers[num a, num b]:num {
    return a + b;
}

// Main program entry point
run {
    val num FIVE = 5;
    num my_result = @add_numbers[5, 10];
    @print["The result is: ${my_result}"];
};


Compilation and Execution

To compile and run your SuperCode program, use the sc compiler from your terminal.

# Compile the file or see help scc
scc hello.su   

# Run the compiled binary
./hello
# Output: The result is: 15

Roadmap & Future Plans

The next major areas of focus for the SuperCode project are:

    Expanding the Standard Library: Building out more modules for common tasks like file I/O and networking.

    Improving Error Messages: Enhancing the compiler to provide more specific, actionable feedback.

    Implementing a Package Manager: Creating a system to easily manage and share SuperCode libraries.
